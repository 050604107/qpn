NOTE: The projects for the eZ430 USB-stick with the MSP430F2013 MCU
have been coded with the new QMSM to save ROM and RAM. For now, this
code has been written by hand, but it really is intended for
automatic generation by the free QM modeling tool. The QMSM code
generation will be supported starting with QM 3.0.0.
